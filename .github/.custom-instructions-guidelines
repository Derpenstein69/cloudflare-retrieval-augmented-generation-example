Tips for defining custom instructions
Keep your instructions short and self-contained. Each instruction should be a single, simple statement. If you need to provide multiple pieces of information, use multiple instructions.

Don't refer to external resources in the instructions, such as specific coding standards,

Define language-specific instructions to get more accurate generated code for each language.

Make it easy to share custom instructions with your team or across projects by storing your instructions in an external file. You can also version control the file to track changes over time.
